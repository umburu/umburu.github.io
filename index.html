<p>My name is Umi Umburu.</p>
<p> I was born and raised in England, relished an enchanted youth in Africa, went to school in India, and have spent most of my adult life following precarious mountain trails and vast wild water crossings that connect the most secluded holy sanctuaries on earth, reaching from the Americas in the West to Mongolia in the East, from Arabia in the South to Armenia in the North, in search of spirit.</p>
<p>The human spirit.</p>
<p>The creative spirit.</p>
<p>The healing spirit.</p>
<p>The spirit that unites us all with a common thread of pain and pleasure, terror and delight, doubt and belief.</p>
<p>This is the weave that connects me to you, and conjoins us all in an ancestry that began with the first footsteps of a primal tribe.</p>
<p>Along the way of my quest, I have encountered the peoples of many faraway lands, leading me to the heart of Jainism and Hinduism, Judaism and Buddhism, to the visionary insights of Christian mystics, to the secret ceremonies of Sumeria, to the ecstatic rituals of Persia, and to the solemn desert caravans of Saharan nomads.</p>
<p>And through this voyage, I have unearthed the memoirs and mythologies, songs and stories, prayers and prophecies of a perennial wisdom that transcends our human difference to celebrate a common history and destiny.</p>
<p>These are the arts of motion and stillness, sound and silence, that summon forth the psalms and poems, mantras and meditations, songs and supplications, forever considered sacred, which have always helped us to hope and heal.</p>
<p> I am here to share with you what I have discovered, so you may uncover for yourself what there is to find, even when that means discarding my teachings to cherish an enlightenment that is yours alone.</p>
<p>I am here to offer what I know, confess what I do not, show my strengths, reveal my frailties and failings, and guide you on a journey toward a light that illuminates what we cannot touch whilst reflecting back to us who we truly are.</p>
