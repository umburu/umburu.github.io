<p>My name is Umi Umburu</p>
<p>I was born and spent my early years in England, was raised in Eastern Africa, went to school in India, and have spent most of my adult life traversing myriad trails between the libraries and monasteries of mystic traditions in search of a wisdom that is often inexplicable through the ordinary means of an analytic mind, yet always irrefutable when we encounter it with an open heart.</p>
<p> I have dwelled as much time with animals as I have with people, and spent  great swathes of time in the company of myself, whilst unravelling the thread that unites us all.</p>
<p>This is the weave that connects me with you, and conjoins us all inseparably from our ancestors as far back as geological time and a tribal dawn.
I am Christian and Buddhist, Hindu and a Jain, Jewish and Sukuma.</p>
<p>Yet I am none of those and more and all myself.</p>
<p>I am here to teach what I have discovered so you may discover for yourself what there is to find, even when that means discarding my teachings in light of the wisdom you unearth.</p>
<p> I am here to share what I know, confess what I do not, reveal my frailties and failings, and guide you on a journey toward a light that illuminates what we cannot reach whilst reflecting back to us who we truly are.</p>
